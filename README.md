### _**Goblin** is a desktop CMS which runs completely offline with some online integration like exporting data._

## Goblin uses:

- Svelte.js - as a frontend js framework.
- Rust - as backend.
- Tauri - as Rust framework basically for managing and communicating with webview, and for packager.
- SQLite - for bundled database.

## Goblin is aiming to be a local CMS:

- with text editor and database(SQLite).
- with Cloudinary integration.
- can manage multiple projects.
- lists all contents in the project, which you can select to see details and also edit.
- converts markdown to JSON that you can export to the specified location.
- has a "Preview Mode" which you can checkout your content being rendered in the specified html.

### And possibly:

- GitHub integration for non technical people (Automatic git push on export).

update: Well this side project was abandoned pretty quickly since I got occupied with a new job back then :D
